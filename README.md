# 🍱 SavorSync — Cook the Culture

*A full-stack journey of food, culture, and community — built with love, UX research, and modern tech*

---

## 🌍 What is SavorSync?

SavorSync is not just a recipe app — it's a culturally immersive cooking platform that helps users discover global dishes, learn the stories behind them, connect with a community of food lovers, and cook with confidence — all in one beautifully designed space.

Built from scratch as part of my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) journey, SavorSync blends UX design, full-stack development, and cultural storytelling. It's powered by real user research, thoughtful design iterations, and a deep belief that food is a universal language that connects us all.

## 🎯 Why I Built It

Coming from a background in intercultural communication now into tech, I've always seen food as a powerful way to understand culture. But most recipe platforms feel transactional with just lists of ingredients with no soul or story.

So I asked myself: **"What if cooking a recipe could feel like stepping into someone's world?"**

SavorSync is my answer:
- **A platform to learn culture through cooking**
- **A space to listen to music, hear stories, and understand the "why" behind each dish**
- **A tool that usesmodern web application devevelopment techonology and even AI to make cooking more accessible and culturally meaningful**
